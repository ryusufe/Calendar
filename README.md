# Hollow Plugin Template

This repository hosts a template for creating plugins for Hollow. While you can use any UI framework you prefer, it is recommended to use lightweight frameworks like **SolidJS**,**Svelte** to ensure better performance due to their small footprint and minimal resource usage.

## Where to start ?

I recommend you start by reading the documentation about how to make plugins, and api :
